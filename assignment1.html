        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am passionate about AI and Web Development. I am pursuing my Btech in Mallareddy College of Engineering and Technology of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I’ve been enhancing my skills in Python, Java, and Web Development, actively building projects that bridge theory with real-world application.<br>
            I'm particularly interested in how AI/ML can be integrated into web and software solutions to create smarter, more intuitive systems. Always eager to learn and collaborate, I’m working toward becoming a well-rounded developer ready to take on the challenges of tomorrow.
